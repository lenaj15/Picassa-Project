Picassa Part 1
Started assignment: 1/12/12 
Finished assignment: 1/16/12
Estimated Number of hours: 13 hours
I thought it would take around 8 hours, so I underestimated
the amount of time.

I did not discuss this assignment with any other students,
but I did talk to Professor Hewner about the assignment.

I looked online for more info on matchers and capturing groups:

I tested this project just with the values and samples from
the compsci 108 website: http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring12/cps108/assign/01_picassa/intrinsics/

Overall I thought this assignment was pretty interesting.
