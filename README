Picassa Part 3
Started assignment: 2/1/12 
Finished assignment: 2/5/12
Estimated Number of hours: 15 hours
I thought it would take around 8 hours, so I underestimated

I did not discuss this assignment with any other students,
but I did talk to Professor Hewner and my UTA about the assignment.

Overall, I really liked the animation portion; I got to play with a lot of really cool designs
